## Problem 1:

Find the last character(non-repeated) from string

Samples:

input:ABA

output:B

input:OPENSHIFT

output:T


## Test cases
Scenario 1: a string with only the first character non-repeated. ex: MCC

Scenario 2: a string with only the last character non-repeated. ex: AAB

Scenario 3: a string without repeated character. ex: BCA

Scenario 4: a string with all repeated character. ex: BBB


## Questions:
1) How to estimate the code complexity?

2) How to optimize the code?

3) How this code could be fail?
